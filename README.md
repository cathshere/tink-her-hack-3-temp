### Project Description
This web application helps users quickly find the best available doctors by mapping their symptoms to relevant medical departments (e.g., chest pain ‚Üí Cardiology). It shows top-rated doctors from different hospital types, providing real-time availability, ratings, and experience.

### The Problem statement
Patients often struggle to find the right doctor based on their symptoms, leading to delays in treatment. Existing systems lack real-time doctor availability and clear department categorization.


### The Solution
We used HTML and CSS for a sleek interface. FastAPI connects the frontend and backend like a fast consultation, while MongoDB keeps doctor data organized and ready. The app quickly maps symptoms to the right department and shows real-time availability‚Äîlike a doctor‚Äôs schedule that‚Äôs always up-to-date. Efficient, quick, and user-friendly‚Äîjust like the best healthcare!
